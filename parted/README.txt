This directory contains the individual functions used in the script broke
into sperate files to simplify modifications. To create the final script you
need to run the buildscript.sh command. The output scrpt can then be
transfered into theparent directory when it is working correctly.

The function files are to be numbered in the order that they are read into
the final script, unnumbered files will not be appended and indicate that
validation is needed.
